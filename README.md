# Comparing-Machine-Learning-Methods-for-Customer-Churn-Prediction
This study's objective is to assess the effectiveness of several machine learning algorithms in predicting churn risk scores. The algorithms were trained and tested using three datasets drawn from various domains (banking, internet, and websites datasets).The assessment included the use of the random forest classifier, decision tree classifier, logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, and K-nearest neighbors. Measures of accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, Cohen's kappa, and MAPE were used to gauge performance. The findings demonstrate that the random forest classifier consistently dominated the competition in all three datasets for all measures, with logistic regression, naive Bayes classifier, and KNN following closely behind. Due to hyperparameter adjustment, the decision tree classifier's performance was almost the same as that of the random forest classifier. These results imply that the random forest classifier is an appropriate method for predicting churn risk scores in different domains, particularly when high accuracy is required.
